			<p class="topic">Jim Harbaugh</p>
			After being with the San Francisco 49ers for four years, head coach Jim 
			Harbaugh returned to Ann Arbor to coach for his alma mater, the University 
			of Michigan. Harbaugh used to play quarterback for the Wolverines for 
			three seasons, eventually bringing Michigan to the Rose Bowl in 1987. 
			Harbaugh, replacing Brady Hoke, will be head coach for the 2015-2016 season. 
			<br>
			<br>
			This 2015-2016 football season, Michigan will be squaring off against
			both Michigan State and Ohio State on its own turf--definitely worth
			checking out if you happen to be in the city!
